## Machine Learning &amp; Natural Language Processing

There are two Python Notebooks (Jupyter) in this project: (1) one for a problem
related to classifying texts (product descriptions) to a product category (classes) &mdash;
`project-products-classification.ipynb`; and (2) one for a problem related to
sentiment analysis (sentiment classification) &mdash; `project-sentiment-analysis.ipynb`.

You may open the Notebooks in a running Jupyter server or you may install an environment
following the instructions below:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter notebook
```

Open the address pointed by the running Jupyter Notebook server. It should open this
project's folder, with all the notebooks available.
