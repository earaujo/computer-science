# The Zelota Experimental Web-crawler

Zelota is an experimental web-crawler intended to support experimental research in information retrieval,
data-intensive text processing, data-mining, user experience, and machine learning. Some propositions for
documents scanning, representation, and retrieval are being turned into code. Nevertheless, this project
is not aimed to turn into a production-ready tool.
