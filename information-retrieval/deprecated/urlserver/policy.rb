# The URL Server policy statement
#
# 1. First of all, every URL has its right to be crawled/fetched,
#     then, one has more priority than others.
# 2. Second, every host has its right to rest for a while (I would
#    say... some bit of seconds)
# 3. Every path, within a host address, should be processed (It
#    must exist some policy to make the URL picker randomic)
# 4. Who has said that the URL Server has to be stateless? It must
#    know what its clients are doing with its resources, in a fancy
#    and painless way, instead
# 5. This server is not for anyone. Where are the security people?
#    Are they alredy dead? Who have hired them?
