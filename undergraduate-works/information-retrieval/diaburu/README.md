# Diaburu

> A static documents store (mainly static HTML documents)

Diaburu is part of an experimental web-crawler/tool intended to support experimental research in information
retrieval, data-intensive text processing, data-mining, user experience, infographics, and machine learning.
Some propositions for documents scanning, representation, and retrieval are being turned into code. Nevertheless,
this project is not ready to be used as a tool in a production environment.
